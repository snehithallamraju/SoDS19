I have been trying to set specific Achievable goals for myself to continue my Data Science learning. I graduate this summer from the Indian School of Business Certificate in Business Analytics (CBA) program in June, and I realize it is important to keep the learning going and apply whatever I have learnt over the last 15 months as a part of the program . Specifcially my aim is to

1. Apply learning from the program in atleast 3 datascience online hackathons, preferably Kaggle and MachineHack
2. Read 3 books related to DataScience
3. Get certified in Tableau
4. Get certified in Azure Machine learning/ Big data Engineering
5. Attend a conferences related to Data/ML
6. Participate in a predictive hackathon
7. Participate in bootcamps related to data, Visualization, Story telling
8. Write atleast one blog a month around a topic
9. Publish atleast one Tableau Viz per fortnight
10. Look out for speaker opportunities and give atleast 3 training/sessions around data topics
